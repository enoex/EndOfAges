# Goals

1. Instil a fascination with exploration. 
2. Reveal few details, let players imagine the rest

These two goals are woven together. The sense, experience, of exploration
requires an egaged imagination. Believabiliy is fundemental.


3. Different views - Map, Battle, Group, Shop
    In group window, should be able to level up entities, select skills, etc.

4. Some variable chance of finding special units / powers / etc. in each node,
like in FTL
