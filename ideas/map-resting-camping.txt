Idea 1:
You can rest / camp, the % that you heal is based on the type of item you use (e.g., a tent and campfire heal fast but maybe a % chance to be seen). 
You can rest as much as you want, but after each rest there is a chance to be either ambushed (high) or visited by a group of traveling adventurers (low).  The latter might involve an actual player's party that has travelled through that node before?

Each time you travel to a new map node, you regain some % of health and ability power.


Idea 2:
Health regens automatically, some other currency is used between battles.
    -Armor durability, # of times an ultimate spell can be used?
    -money?
    -Something that you would not want to lose over the course of the game, but
    could be replinished at a price
