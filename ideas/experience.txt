The game creates an experience, but it is not the experience.

What is the intended experience this game aims to create?

-Sense of exploration
-Picking a combination of characters / spells and progressing, using their
combinations. Like picking a party structure in EQ or choosing the right party
in FF
-Progression - getting weapons / armor, leveling up, upgrading skills
    -Customizing characters - upgrade skills?

--> With exploration and choosing a party / leveling it up in mind, it seems
ok to skirt other kinds of storytelling experience? Ideally, both these
experiences and story telling would exist


------------
Death:
    -Once an entity dies, it is dead. No resuruction spells?
        -Can hire / find other entities though

------------
Adventuring / Returning home
    -Should be able to return home? But not magically in a single leap?


---------------
Learning new skills
    -When you get a new skill, it starts out very bad until you use it / level it up

-Skills level up as you use them?


-------------
Explict story vs player stories
    -provide explict story only as a way to enhance the player story

------------------
Exploration : capture essential experience of Battlestar Galatica - lost, cannot
    return home, have to keep going, no end, looking for home
    -Maybe you can find a suitable settlement, and you can choose to retire (keeping
    everything) or continue onwards
