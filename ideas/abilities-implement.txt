Buffs / Duration based effects
----------------
Two types : 
    1. static effects that only affect stats
    2. triggered effects that trigger on taking damage or receiving health

Static
-------
Add an effect to the entity
    -call entity.addEffect( ---- ), which can change any property.
        Can pass in either a positive or negative number or positive or negative percent 

    -can remove by calling entity.removeEffect( ---- )

-need to determine if effect is positive or negative
    -e.g., ability like cancel magic to remove negative effect


-effect type (magic, physical, element)


Triggered
-------
same as above
    -when taking damage or heal, loop through triggered effects

Example ability effects
    -Wards : Asborb X damage
    -Damage Shield : return X damage to attacker
    -Debuffs : lower some stat
    -Turn target into an animal / change sprite, add some stat effect
    -% Chance to do extra damage on hit 
    -Ressurect(?)
    -When healed or damage, do some effect

    -When entity dies, heal
    -When entity takes damage, heal other entity
