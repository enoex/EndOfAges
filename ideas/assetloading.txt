# Asset loading ideas
-On server, have an endpoint that loads all svg assets, turn them into a single
SVG doc, then return the doc
-Client hits endpoint for the SVG doc (or is embedded on page load?), then all
sprites / effects can be copied by selecting the proper element


# Customizing sprites
Weapons / armor / etc are also single sprites, creating a ssprite with the armor 
and weapons is done by cloning the items and cloning the entity, then placing 
them together
