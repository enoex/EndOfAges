How to choose abilities?


# Selecting Ability
Entity has a "target ability" it wants to use. Is chosen after using an ability 
or when the battle starts. 
    -At (random) pick an ability, based on health and aggro list and potentially
    the health of enemies in the shit list, but this may be too difficult:
        if an enemy attacks someone lower on the list because their health
        is low.  Will need to take into account aggro / threat

-When health change, call the ability selection logic again
-Chance to randomly select ability after selecting the best one


-% Chance to want to flee

# Aggro

# Battle Value

# Combat Logic
Where should it live? 

1. Model
    -On a per model basis. Benefit : can have custom behavior PER entity

2. Separate Combat controller 
    -More general, separates out logic from model. How to have a custom 
    battle function though?
    -Ideally, the combat AI part would be a sort of sub method of the combat
    controller / view. 

Need to decrease timer when an ability is used
    -Could use a global event or a view (or combat controller) specific event



# Using Abilities
Should abilities have a 'casting time' ? i.e., Ability A takes 1 second to cast, Ability 2 takes 4 seconds?
Chance for interuption?
-Maybe not - might add another layer of unnecessary complexity. Keep it simple
