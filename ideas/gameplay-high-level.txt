Fast vs Control
-Win early or win late
    Can there be two "broad" strategies which exist? Winning quickly or 
    winning slowly?
        -e.g., quickly would be a bunch of dps like characters. If you don't
        win fast, however, you'll probably lose.

    -Classes with fast casting spells and classes with slow casting spells
        -Some are a mix

    -In general, like in M:TG, you either try to win fast or slow
