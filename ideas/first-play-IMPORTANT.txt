1. Learn single simple technique in isolation (kihon)
2. Repeat technique (kihon-kata)
3. Learn how different techniques can be combined (kata)
4. Test them in a real fight (kumite)

---First experience - this is important
----------------------
For the game, player could start off with a single entity and a single skill.
First fight is a very easy enemy, which you get some reward, maybe the next
thing is a shop, then the next is two enemies, then you get a new skill unlocked,
then you get a new party member, then fight an easier enemy to learn how to
use both (the second party member has skills that are effective against the new
enemy, the first entity's skills are not so effective - e.g., fire vs water)
this cycle continues, until the boss fight, at which point all your skills are 
tested and you beat the level (or die, and get sent back to the character creation
process with characters unlocked but items / skills not? Or something. Need to unlock
things here, but make it obvious that you need to actually travel back next time to keep stuff...)

First time playing, you get a single character with a single skill. As you beat
levels, you get a choice of other characters. After beating the first "tutorial" map,
you could continue with the part or get sent back to reselect / rebuild your group
