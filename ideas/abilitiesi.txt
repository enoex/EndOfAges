Each ability has at least one elemental type

Abilities should be able to both heal and do damage

Abilities should scale in power / effects with level
    -can be 'upgraded' to have more effects
        -can create composite abilities by chaining multiple ability effects

    -entities store their own copy of an ability, as they can modify them

-As abilities level up, so do their power costs

-Does an ability get stronger the longer you wait to use it?

# Ability Cast Duration / Interupptions
Should abilities be able to be interuppted?
Should you be able to use another ability when you're in the middle of using
an ability?

TODO: Figure out all the 'types' of ability effects - missle, direct, AoE, etc.
