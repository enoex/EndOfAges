===================

Ability order should be similar as possible
could be the same format for each class;

e.g., for DPS: 
    q = basic damage
    w = second damage
    e = debuff
    r = ult

for heal:
    q = self heal
    w = other heal
    e = buff
    r = ult

tank
    q = dmg
    w = taunt
    e = ?
    r = ult



doesn't have to follow format, but should try to maintain context

Maybe all q and w are always for others, e is reserved
for self / group?
    

===================




Each ability has at least one elemental type

Abilities should be able to both heal and do damage

Abilities should scale in power / effects with level
    -can be 'upgraded' to have more effects
        -can create composite abilities by chaining multiple ability effects

    -entities store their own copy of an ability, as they can modify them

-As abilities level up, so do their power costs

-Does an ability get stronger the longer you wait to use it?

# Ability Cast Duration / Interupptions
Should abilities be able to be interuppted?
Should you be able to use another ability when you're in the middle of using
an ability?


--------

TODO: Figure out all the 'types' of ability effects - missle, direct, AoE, etc.

----------

-Each character has set abilities, but you can customize them
    -progress horizontally
        -choose additioanl effects? specialize how you want the ability to
        scale   
            -damage, focus of element, etc.
----------------

Ability Ideas:
    -Abilities that can only be used once per battle
        -Can be only used once per every n battles

====================

All abilities should share a base scale, so we can calculate power / etc. for a
class based on a collection of abilities

-----------------

-Abilities that do an effect based on the entitiy's attribute

--------------------------------------------------------

Mods
-----
crit chance
additional 'true' damage
elemental modifiers

-increase speed of timer (aka, decrease ability cast times - modify abilities themselves)



** Modify abilities themselves (cast time, duration, etc)

---------------

Abilities that do more damage or are more effective when an enemy's timer bar is low or high

-----------------------------------
Abilities that deal true damage over time
-Stat for defending true damage, for dealing additional true damage
    -What is true damage? Damage that ignores armor and magic resist. Should it
    ignore elemental affects as well?

----
Abilities that improve based on entity killing another entity
    -e.g., when entity kills another entity, they get some massive stat boost or
        do more damage or can attack faster

=========================

Chance for multiple hits for physical abilities.
    -Chance to consume less time for magic abilities?

Abilities as components? Ability's effect function calls different funcs based on props...e.g., effect: ... callDamage(); callHeal(); callBuff(); etc. Custom effects can use the prototype to make it easier to define things


-Some special when timer bar is all the way full. Abilities do more damage, you take less damage
