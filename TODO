1. Targetting - you should be able to select an ability to use BEFORE the timer is up. It should automatically recast if set

2. Saving - should only be able to save on map, not in battle. If exited in a battle, should cancel the battle?

How to handle DoTs / abilities that trigger over time?
    Ideas
        -each entity has a list of spell effects, check the list each tick
        -each ability's effect function handles it - using setTimeout
            -can't use setTimeout as easily if pausing...
            -could have a global pause event, which would clear all timers
                -then, when NOT paused, restart timer
                -resume setTimeouts in unpause / runTimer function
