1. Targetting - you should be able to select an ability to use BEFORE the timer is up. It should automatically recast if set

2. Saving - should only be able to save on map, not in battle. If exited in a battle, should cancel the battle?

How to handle DoTs / abilities that trigger over time?
    Ideas
        -each entity has a list of spell effects, check the list each tick
        -each ability's effect function handles it - using setTimeout
            -can't use setTimeout as easily if pausing...
            -could have a global pause event, which would clear all timers
                -then, when NOT paused, restart timer
                -resume setTimeouts in unpause / runTimer function

-----------------

Get rid of bootstrap?

-----------------------

Good solid name generation
    -based on races?

------------------
fonts
    -Use google web fonts
        POTENTIAL: Alegreya (provides a bunch)

----------------

battle AI _ each entity should have its own battle AI

---------------

Ideas about gameplay - resources - if running low, start to move slower, more vulnerable?
    -need incentive to move forward

CURRENT

---- Abilities

-- Abilities : Buffs : Should not be able to stack all buffs

---- Abilities : Cooldown

**********************************

----- Save breaks
    save is janky

-track all damage


*** HEAL Resists / Magic Power effects

***************************************************** 
TODO: Extra damage from elemental effects


*********** STUNS

===========================================================================
New Idea:
    -Effect log. A small text window showing history of all effects?
        -buff wears off, buff add, etc

====>>>> Data viz for end of fight, either on win or loss. Listen for events
====>>>>>>>> Track all effects by time

((((((((((MAP IS BROKE IN FIREFOX )))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
------- Page visibility - doesn't stop timer when switching page
